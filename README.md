# Titanic Classification / BharatIntern
In the Titanic classification project, a predictive model was developed utilizing the Titanic.csv dataset. 

The primary objective was to create a robust machine learning model capable of predicting which passengers were likely to survive the ill-fated Titanic voyage. Leveraging features such as passenger class, age, gender, and embarkation point from the dataset, a classification algorithm was trained on the historical data to discern patterns indicative of survival. Following the model development, the test data was utilized to validate the model's predictive accuracy. 

Subsequently, the data of passengers predicted to survive were extracted and stored in a dedicated CSV file named resultfile.csv. This file serves as a valuable record of the model's predictions and contributes to the ongoing exploration and analysis of survival patterns among Titanic passengers.
